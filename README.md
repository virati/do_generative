# Generative models for DOs

## Overview
Dynamic oscillations (DOs) are evoked in certain cases of DBS within the SCC [[tiruvadi2022]]().

## Models


### Delay Circuit
A simple delay circuit generates a comb filter.
A time-varying delay in the delay circuit can shape the DO.


### Wilson-Cowan Network
A simple Wilson-Cowan network with edge dropout generating DOs.


### Wilson-Cowan with Depletion
WC network model with addition of depletion, implemented as an edge that decays as a function of high-frequency stimulation.
